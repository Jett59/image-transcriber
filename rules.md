- Give the page number at the top of the document in the format `p<n`.
    * Example: `p3`
- Replace images (diagrams etc.) with alt-text.
    * Example: `[A diagram showing a concave-down parabola passing through $(2, 3)$ and touching the $x$-axis at $(-1, 0)$ and $(5, 0)$]`
    * Example: `[A diagram of a circle with a radius of $5$ and a center at the origin $(0, 0)$]`
    * Example: `[A diagram of a right-angled triangle with legs of length $3$ and $4$ and a hypotenuse of length $5$]`
- Be literal about what is there; don't make anything up.
    * Example: `[A diagram of a concave-up parabola with no points marked]`
    * Example: `[A diagram of a cubic function]`
- Use `$` to begin and end inline math mode.
    * Example: `The equation of a circle is $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ (where $r$ is the radius of the circle)`
- Always use `$$` to begin and end display math mode.
    * Example: `$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$`
